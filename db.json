Starting Tuesday, the gaming platform’s facial verification system — linked with big data from the central public security system — will help monitor players and detect individuals who spend a significant amount of time online at night, according to the company. The initiative, dubbed “Midnight Patrol,” is aimed at deterring minors from using “tricks” to pose as adults between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m."

        "mainDesc" : "Dallas-based auction house Heritage Auctions sold an unopened copy of Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64 for US$1.56 million. The winner of the auction, who is apparently ready to pay an unfathomable sum for a 25-year-old video game, has not been revealed. The unknown buyer will become the happy owner of a brilliant video game which has garnered the near-perfect grade of 9.8 for its mint condition. It's highly unlikely that the sealed collector's item will ever be opened, since certain old games can evidently turn into appreciating assets and can therefore serve as a smart investment. This is especially true for games that have played a significant role in the history of video games, with Super Mario 64 being one of those titles."
